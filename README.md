## First Milestone Project - User-Centric Frontend Development

This is my personal profile website which I can present to prospective employers or convert into a blog. The profile showcases my employment and educational history, the software experience I have, along with a few GitHub projects I have done which I will update with more up-to-date projects when I have completed more. I have also got a landing page with a short section about me, and a gallery page which showcases some photos I've taken in my travels. Finally, there is a contact page which allows the user to send me an email directly.

## UX

css-tricks was very handy:
To sort out the emailing functionality on the contact page I used [this](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-mailto-links/) page.
Also, used it for [colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)

used bootstrap for forms and grid and flex mainly
[flex](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/)

The dropdown feature that is collapsible I used from the previous "Whiskey Drop" tutorial which I replicated [here](https://github.com/CharOConnell/whiskey-drop) from the tutorials within the User Centric Development Module of the Code Institute course. This feature uses JQuery and other JavaScript features, taken from the Bootstrap JS CDN. Also, I used information about the navbar-dark from [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/).
used google fonts
